This object is responsible for deciding when to re-render the view and how to react to user input. With React, these view-controllers objects are called components. A component knows how to render its view and how to handle to the user’s interaction with it.</p>\n<p>The interesting thing is that React is figuring out by itself when to re-render a view and how to do this in the most efficient way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.mayflower.de/3937-Backbone-React.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full post…</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Using facebook’s React with require.js {#using-facebooks-react-with-requirejs}</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.xenji.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mario Mueller</a> wrote a menu component in React and was able to easily integrate it with require.js, EventEmitter2 and bower.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I recently stumbled upon facebook’s React library, which is a JavaScript library for building reusable frontend components. Even if this lib is only at version 0.3.x it behaves very stable, it is fast and is fun to code. I’m a big fan of require.js, so I tried to use React within the require.js eco system. It was not as hard as expected and here are some examples and some thoughts about it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.xenji.com/2013/06/facebooks-react-require-js.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full post…</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Origins of React {#origins-of-react}</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.petehunt.net/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Pete Hunt</a> explained what differentiates React from other JavaScript libraries in <a href=\"/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html\">a previous blog post</a>. <a href=\"http://leebyron.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Lee Byron</a> gives another perspective on Quora:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>React isn’t quite like any other popular JavaScript libraries, and it solves a very specific problem: complex UI rendering. It’s also intended to be used along side many other popular libraries. For example, React works well with Backbone.js, amongst many others.</p>\n<p>React was born out of frustrations with the common pattern of writing two-way data bindings in complex MVC apps. React is an implementation of one-way data bindings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/React-JS-Library/How-is-Facebooks-React-JavaScript-library/answer/Lee-Byron?srid=3DcX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full post…</a></p>\n</blockquote>","excerpt":"React was open sourced two weeks ago and it’s time for a little round-up of what has been going on.
